# License Renewal Process for Ambulatory Surgery Centers

## Overview
Texas ASCs must maintain current licenses to operate legally. License renewal is required every two years and must be submitted at least 45 days before expiration.

## Renewal Timeline
- **90 days before expiration**: Begin preparation and document gathering
- **60 days before expiration**: Submit renewal application
- **45 days before expiration**: Absolute deadline for submission
- **30 days before expiration**: Follow up if no confirmation received

## Required Documents
1. Completed HHS license renewal application
2. Current facility floor plan (if changes made)
3. Updated list of all medical staff with credentials
4. Proof of medical malpractice insurance for all providers
5. Fire marshal inspection certificate (if required)
6. Renewal fee payment ($500 for initial submission, $250 for each additional operating room)

## Common Reasons for Delays
- Incomplete staff credential documentation
- Expired malpractice insurance certificates
- Missing signatures on application
- Incorrect or missing fee payment
- Outdated facility information

## Best Practices
- Set up automated reminders 90 days before expiration
- Maintain a renewal checklist
- Keep digital copies of all supporting documents
- Verify all staff credentials are current before starting renewal
- Submit early to allow time for any corrections

## Consequences of Late Renewal
- Operations must cease if license expires
- Fines up to $1,000 per day of operation without valid license
- Potential revocation of license
- Loss of payer contracts and credentialing
