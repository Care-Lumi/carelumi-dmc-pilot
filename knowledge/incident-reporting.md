- Workplace injuries
- Security incidents
- Disruptive behavior

### Facility-Related Incidents

### Near Miss Events
- Events that could have caused harm but didn't
- System failures caught before reaching patient
- Equipment issues identified before use

## Reporting Process

### Immediate Actions
1. Ensure patient safety
2. Provide necessary treatment
3. Notify physician immediately if patient involved
4. Secure any equipment involved
5. Preserve evidence if necessary

### Completing Incident Report

- Determine severity level
- Initiate immediate corrective actions
- Notify risk manager if serious event

### Root Cause Analysis
Required for serious events:
- Wrong site/wrong procedure/wrong patient
- Unanticipated death or serious injury
- Severe medication error
- Equipment failure causing injury
- Anesthesia-related complications

### RCA Process
1. Form investigation team
2. Gather all facts and evidence
3. Identify all contributing factors
4. Determine root causes
5. Develop action plan
6. Implement corrective actions
7. Monitor effectiveness

## Severity Classification

### Level 1 (Minor)
- No patient harm
- Near miss events
- Minor equipment issues
- Resolved quickly

### Level 2 (Moderate)
- Temporary patient harm
- Required intervention
- Equipment failure affecting care
- Significant delay in treatment

### Level 3 (Serious)
- Serious patient harm
- Prolonged hospitalization
- Permanent harm possible
- Death

## Corrective Actions

### Types of Actions
- Process changes
- Policy revisions
- Staff education
- Equipment replacement
- Environmental modifications
- Increased monitoring

### Implementation
- Assign responsibility
- Set completion timeline
- Communicate to all staff
- Document implementation
- Monitor effectiveness

## Trend Analysis
- Review all incidents monthly
- Identify patterns and trends
- Compare to previous periods
- Share findings with QA committee
- Implement system-wide improvements

## Non-Punitive Culture
- Focus on systems, not individuals
