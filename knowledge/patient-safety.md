# Patient Safety Standards for ASCs

## Overview
Patient safety is the highest priority for Ambulatory Surgery Centers. Comprehensive safety protocols reduce risk and improve outcomes.

## Universal Protocol

### Pre-Procedure Verification
- Verify correct patient using two identifiers
- Verify correct procedure
- Verify correct site/side/level
- Verify all required documents present
- Verify all equipment and supplies available

### Site Marking
- Mark procedure site before patient enters OR
- Use standardized marking (initials or "YES")
- Involve patient in marking when possible
- Mark must be visible after patient positioned

### Time Out
- Conducted immediately before incision
- All team members participate actively
- Verify patient identity, procedure, site
- Review anticipated critical events
- Confirm antibiotic prophylaxis given
- Confirm any special equipment needs

## Medication Safety

### Medication Administration
- Two-person verification for high-alert medications
- Clear labeling of all medications and solutions
- "Read back" for verbal orders
- Document all medications administered
- Monitor for adverse reactions

### High-Alert Medications
- Insulin
- Anticoagulants

- Sedatives
- Neuromuscular blocking agents
- Moderate sedation agents

### Medication Errors

- Implement corrective actions
- Share learnings with all staff

## Infection Prevention

### Hand Hygiene
- Before and after patient contact
- Before aseptic procedures
- After contact with body fluids
- Before donning and after removing gloves
- Use soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizer

### Surgical Site Infection Prevention
- Appropriate hair removal (clippers, not razors)
- Proper skin antisepsis
- Timely antibiotic prophylaxis (within 60 minutes)
- Maintain normothermia
- Control blood glucose in diabetics

- Vital signs stable for required period
- Adequate pain control
- Able to tolerate oral fluids (if required)
